# The goal of this project is to highlight the importance of establishing a global disease surveillance and response system and sustaining it. Wildlife are known reservoirs for zoonotic diseases which are a major contributor to emerging diseases. Hopefully this project will also highlight the importance of better anti-poaching measures to control the spread of these disease which will also improve global security. There are many factors that have led to the increase in emergence of zoonotic diseases. Human travel and increased mobility, changes in human eating patterns and culture, and rapid shipments of livestock.  This need for better anti-poaching measures should also be considered as a tool to control the spread of zoonotic diseases.
